HW1 - Code Refactoring

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate knowledge related to altering HTML & CSS code in ways that make them more efficient and condensed without changing the look or functionality of an existing site.

Throughout this module, I learned there are many ways of writing code and while there is no way that is ultimately correct, there are approaches that are considered best practices for accessibility purposes. These can also assist any future developer (or future you) working on the project, by improving readability and revealing the initial thought process.

## Usage
